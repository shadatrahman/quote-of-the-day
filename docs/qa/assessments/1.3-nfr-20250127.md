## Recommendations for NFR Improvement

### High Priority

1. **Fix Integration Tests**: Resolve authentication mocking issues
2. **Add E2E Testing**: Validate complete subscription flow
3. **Implement Audit Logging**: Add comprehensive subscription change logging

### Medium Priority

1. **Add Caching**: Implement subscription data caching
2. **Enhance Error Messages**: Improve user-facing error messages
3. **Optimize Analytics**: Improve database queries for analytics

### Low Priority

1. **Add Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive subscription monitoring
2. **Improve Documentation**: Add more detailed test setup documentation
3. **Performance Testing**: Add load testing for subscription endpoints

## Conclusion

The subscription management implementation demonstrates strong NFR compliance in most areas, with particular strengths in security, performance, and maintainability. However, the integration test failures represent a significant reliability concern that should be addressed before production deployment.

**Overall Assessment**: GOOD with concerns about reliability due to integration test failures.

**Recommendation**: Address integration test issues and add E2E testing validation before production deployment.
