# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Clean, sophisticated interface that reflects the premium nature of curated content for intelligent professionals. Emphasis on minimal friction - users should receive quotes effortlessly while having powerful but unobtrusive tools for starring, searching, and accessing historical content. The design should feel more like a premium productivity tool than a typical inspirational app.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Push-first experience**: Primary interaction is passive consumption via notifications
- **Quick engagement patterns**: One-tap starring, swipe gestures for basic actions
- **Deep-dive accessibility**: Powerful search and historical browsing when needed
- **Subscription transparency**: Clear value demonstration for premium features

## Core Screens and Views
- **Daily Quote View**: Main screen displaying current quote with starring/sharing options
- **Historical Archive**: Searchable list of all previously received quotes
- **Starred Quotes Collection**: User's personal collection of favorited quotes for decision-making reference
- **Settings & Preferences**: Notification timing, subscription management, personalization options
- **Onboarding Flow**: Premium positioning and timing preference setup
