# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: `default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' https://api.quoteoftheday.com https://*.stripe.com; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://*.stripe.com`
- XSS Prevention: Content sanitization and secure rendering in Flutter widgets
- Secure Storage: Flutter Secure Storage for JWT tokens and sensitive user data

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Pydantic model validation with custom validators for email, password strength
- Rate Limiting: 100 requests/minute per IP for authentication, 1000 requests/minute for general API usage
- CORS Policy: Restricted to mobile app origins and admin dashboard domains

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: Secure storage using Flutter Secure Storage with biometric protection
- Session Management: JWT with 24-hour expiration and refresh token rotation
- Password Policy: Minimum 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character requirements

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: <10MB APK for Android, <25MB IPA for iOS
- Loading Strategy: Progressive loading with skeleton screens, image lazy loading
- Caching Strategy: HTTP caching for quotes (1 hour TTL), offline storage for starred quotes

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: <200ms for quote retrieval, <500ms for search operations
- Database Optimization: Connection pooling (10 connections), query optimization with proper indexing
- Caching Strategy: Redis caching for frequently accessed quotes (15 minutes TTL), user session data (24 hours TTL)
