### Data Models

[Source: architecture/data-models.md#user]

**User Model Structure:**

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string; // UUID primary key
  email: string; // Email for authentication
  created_at: string; // Account creation timestamp
  is_active: boolean; // Account status
  subscription_tier: "FREE" | "PREMIUM"; // Default to FREE
  notification_settings: NotificationSettings;
  timezone: string; // User's timezone
  last_quote_delivered: string | null;
}

interface NotificationSettings {
  enabled: boolean;

- `auth_login_test.dart` - Login and session management

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

1. **Type Sharing:** Use packages/shared-types for User model across Flutter and Python
2. **API Error Handling:** Standardized error format with code, message, timestamp, request_id
3. **Authentication Flow:** JWT tokens must include user_id, email, subscription_tier, expiration
4. **Async Operations:** All I/O operations must be async/await in both Flutter and Python
5. **Environment Configuration:** Never hardcode URLs or API keys - use environment variables
6. **Database Transactions:** Use transactions for multi-step operations like user registration

### Security Considerations

[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#authentication-flow-implementation]

1. **Password Security:** Use bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds (12+)
2. **JWT Security:** Use strong secret key, short expiration times (1-2 hours)
3. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting for auth endpoints (5 requests/minute)
4. **Email Verification:** Require email verification before account activation
5. **Password Reset:** Secure token generation with expiration (1 hour)
6. **Input Validation:** Comprehensive validation for all user inputs

### External API Integration

[Source: architecture/external-apis.md]

**Firebase Authentication:**

- Use Firebase Admin SDK for token verification
- Custom JWT generation for backend API access
- Email verification integration

**AWS SES Integration:**

- Email templates for verification and password reset
- Bounce and complaint handling
- Domain verification for production

**Environment Variables Required:**

- `FIREBASE_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS_PATH` - Firebase service account JSON
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - AWS credentials for SES
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - AWS credentials for SES
- `SES_EMAIL_FROM` - Verified sender email address
